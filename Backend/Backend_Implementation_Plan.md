# AutoSpot Backend Implementation Plan

## 1. Tech Stack Recommendation
- **Language/Framework:** Python + FastAPI (recommended for speed, async support, and auto-generated docs)
- **Database:** MongoDB (Atlas cloud or self-hosted)
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Deployment:** AWS EC2 (for backend), MongoDB Atlas or AWS RDS (for database)
- **Version Control:** Git (GitHub or GitLab)
- **API Testing:** Postman or Swagger UI

---

## 2. Development Phases & Key Tasks

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Infrastructure
- Initialize Git repository and project structure
- Set up FastAPI project with virtual environment and dependencies (`fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `pymongo`, `python-dotenv`, etc.)
- Write a basic README
- Create a Dockerfile and ensure the backend can run in a container
- Set up local MongoDB or connect to MongoDB Atlas for development

### Phase 2: User & Authentication Module
- Implement user registration (email, password, validation)
- Implement login (JWT or session-based authentication)
- Password encryption and validation
- Password reset (email OTP)
- User profile management (including vehicle info)

### Phase 3: Parking Lot & Slot Management
- Design data models for parking lots, slots, and their status (free/occupied/reserved/assigned)
- Implement APIs for:
  - Retrieving parking lot layout and slot info
  - Updating slot status (real-time updates)
  - Slot assignment and recommendation logic (nearest to entrance/destination)

### Phase 4: Reservation & Booking
- Implement reservation APIs (create, cancel, modify)
- Handle time conflict checks for reservations
- Integrate payment simulation for reservations (real payment can be added later)
- Query reservation history for users and operators

### Phase 5: Payment & Wallet
- Implement wallet balance management
- Parking fee calculation and payment APIs
- Transaction and billing history
- Subscription and points system (purchase, cancel, use points)

### Phase 6: Notification & Reminders
- Integrate email notification service (e.g., SendGrid, AWS SES)
- Implement reminders for parking time, slot changes, subscription expiry, etc.

### Phase 7: Operator & Reporting
- Operator dashboard APIs (real-time slot monitoring, editing slot info)
- Generate reports (usage, revenue, trends)
- Export reports as CSV/PDF

### Phase 8: Advanced Features & Optimization
- Pathfinding/navigation API (entrance to slot)
- Environmental impact statistics (COâ‚‚, fuel, time saved)
- Security enhancements (API permissions, data encryption)
- Unit tests and API documentation

## 3. Recommended Development Order (Agile Iterations)
1. Infrastructure & Project Setup
2. User Registration/Login
3. Parking Lot & Slot Management
4. Reservation/Booking
5. Payment & Wallet
6. Notifications
7. Operator & Reporting
8. Advanced Features & Optimization

---

## 4. Deliverables for Each Phase
- API endpoints (with Swagger/OpenAPI docs)
- Unit tests for each module
- Docker image for backend
- Database schema documentation
- README and deployment instructions

---

## 5. AWS Deployment Plan (after local development)
- Register AWS account
- Launch EC2 instance for backend deployment
- Set up MongoDB Atlas or AWS RDS for database
- Configure security groups (allow only necessary ports)
- Deploy Dockerized backend to EC2
- Set environment variables for production (DB connection, secrets)
- Test API connectivity and database integration

---

## 6. Best Practices
- Use environment variables for sensitive info
- Write unit tests for all critical logic
- Keep API documentation up to date
- Use Git branches for feature development
- Communicate API changes with frontend team
